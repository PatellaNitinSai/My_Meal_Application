# Restaurent Project

## Description
## Our Unique Feature is 
**Single Meal Partner** which connects users with a meal-sharing partner to enhance social dining experiences, split costs, and reduce food waste.
Single-Meal-Partner is an innovative feature designed to enhance the dining experience by connecting users with a meal-sharing partner. This feature is ideal for individuals who want to:

# Enjoy social dining with like-minded people.
# Split the cost of meals.
# Reduce food waste by sharing.
## How It Works
## Opt-In:
**.** While placing an order, users can choose the Single-Meal-Partner option to share their meal.

## Preferences:
## Users can set preferences, such as:

**.** Meal type (veg/non-veg).
**.** Budget range.
**.** Dining style (casual/formal).
**.** Matching Algorithm:
**.** The system uses an intelligent matching algorithm to pair users based on their:

**.** Location proximity.
**.** Meal preferences.
**.** Time availability.
**.** Anonymity & Security:

## Users remain anonymous until they confirm the match.
A chat feature allows them to discuss details securely within the platform.
Order Finalization:
Once both users confirm the match, the order is finalized. The meal is shared, and the bill is split based on their agreed preferences.

## Post-Dining Interaction:
After dining, users can rate their experience and provide feedback to improve future matches.

## Benefits
Encourages social interaction and networking.
Offers cost-effective dining options.
Promotes sustainability by reducing food waste.
